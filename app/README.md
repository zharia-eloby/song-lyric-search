# Lyric Search Website
A frontend project developed by Zharia Eloby

This is a website built using React that allows a user to search for song lyrics, given they provide
an artist name and song title.

This is purely a front-end project. The backend is provided by [NTag/lyrics.ovh](https://github.com/NTag/lyrics.ovh/).
